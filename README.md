## Evlib + FTC = ❤️

This is the place where I (zbrachinara) do all my experiments on the ftc and ev libraries. Some of
these ideas might make it, some might not.

Pending experiments:

* JNI and Rust
* Configure publishing for Maven Central
* Escape java type variance with monomorphization (Options API)
